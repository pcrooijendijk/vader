### Exploit Scenario:
In this section, we will attempt to show how a malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability. 

1.  A malicious actor attempts to send an email to a victim. The email contains a link to the page `http://<mywebsite>/api/verify?email=<victim@gmail.com>`
2.  The user clicks on the link and is redirected to the `http://<mywebsite>/api/verify?email=<victim@gmail.com>` page. 
3.  The `verify` page sends a verification email to the victim. The email contains a link to the page `http://<mywebsite>/api/verify/<code>?email=<victim@gmail.com>`.
4.  The user clicks on the link and is redirected to the `http://<mywebsite>/api/verify/<code>?email=<victim@gmail.com>` page. 
5.  The `verify` page processes the user's request and sends an email to the victim with a new password.

### Why It Happens:
The issue here is that the `verify` page is vulnerable to [open redirect](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Open_Redirect) attacks. This is because the page is accepting the user's input and sending it back in the redirect URL. The server is trusting the user's input and not validating it.

### Security Implications:
The malicious actor can redirect the user to a different website which could be a phishing site or a malicious website. If the victim clicks on the link, they will be redirected to the malicious website and could potentially be tricked into divulging sensitive information.

### Suggested Fix:
In this section, we will discuss how to fix this vulnerability.

1.  First, we will need to validate the user's input. We can do this by checking if the input is a valid email address. We can use the [validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator) package for this.

```
const validator = require("validator");
