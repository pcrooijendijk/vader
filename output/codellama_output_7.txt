Metadata:
CWE: CWE-22
Severity: High
Language: python

### Explanation:
The program is listening on the socket. It waits for a connection request from the client.

The client sends the data to the socket.

The socket then reads the file and sends it back to the client.

### Impact:
The data is being read from the file and then sent to the client. The client has the ability to access the file.

### Solution:

The file should be read and sent only if the connection is authenticated.

### Steps to mitigate:

1. Include a check for authentication before reading the file and sending it to the client.
2. Send the file over an encrypted connection.
