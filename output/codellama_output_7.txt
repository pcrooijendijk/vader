Metadata:
CWE: CWE-22
Severity: High
Language: python

### Explanation:

The server does not use an SSL context to wrap the socket, and as a result, it is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Impact:

An attacker can intercept the connection and steal data.

### Resolution:

The server should use an SSL context to wrap the socket.

### Internal Notes:

N/A

### References:

### CWE: CWE-22

### Severity: High

### Description:

The server uses a non-SSL socket to communicate with the client. This means that any data exchanged between the client and server is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Impact:

An attacker can intercept the connection and steal data.

### Resolution:

The server should use an SSL socket to communicate with the client.

### Internal Notes:

N/A
