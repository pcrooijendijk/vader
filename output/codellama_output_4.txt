CWE: CWE-916
Severity: Low
Language: python, javascript

Given the above patch and metadata, give an explanation based on the following template:
### Explanation:
Vulnerability Type: 
Severity:  
Root Cause:  
Exploit Scenario:  
Why It Happens:  
Security Implications:  
Suggested Fix:  

### Exploit Scenario:
A user is able to upload an encrypted file. The server then decrypts the file and writes it to disk. The attacker can then upload a malicious file that will be decrypted by the server and executed.

### Security Implications:
An attacker can upload a malicious file to the server and execute it. This can result in an RCE.

### Suggested Fix:
Use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES-256-GCM.

### How to test this patch
* Upload a file to the server
* Open the file in your browser and inspect the contents
* Make sure it's not a malicious file
* If it's not a malicious file, try uploading a malicious file to the server
* If it is a malicious file, the server will decrypt it and execute it. If the file is malicious, the server will not be able to decrypt it.

### How to reproduce the vulnerability
* Upload a file to the server
* Open the file in your browser and inspect the contents
* Make sure it's not a malicious file
* If it's not a malicious file, try uploading a malicious file to the server
* If it is a malicious file, the server will decrypt it and execute it. If the file is malicious, the server will not be able to decrypt it.

### Notes
* The vulnerability is in the decryption function.
* The vulnerability occurs when a malicious file is uploaded to the server. The file is encrypted by the server, then decrypted by the server. The server does not verify the integrity of the decrypted file.
* The attacker is able to upload a malicious file that will be decrypted by the server and executed.
* The attacker is able to upload a malicious file that will be decrypted by the server, but the decrypted file will not be executable.
* The attacker is able to upload a malicious file that will be decrypted by the server, but the decrypted file will not be executable.
