Patch:
state_dict_path = os.path.join(args.repo_path, subfolder, "diffusion_pytorch_model.bin")

# Safe: only load as state_dict (not entire model object)
state_dict = torch.load(state_dict_path, map_location="cpu")

if not isinstance(state_dict, dict):
    raise ValueError("Loaded file is not a valid state_dict dictionary.")

model.load_state_dict(state_dict)


Metadata:
CWE: CWE-78
Severity: High
Language: javascript, html

### Explanation:

The application loads the following file as a model:

```
state_dict_path = os.path.join(args.repo_path, subfolder, "diffusion_pytorch_model.bin")
```

However, the file is loaded as a state_dict, which is only part of the model:

```
model.load_state_dict(state_dict)
```

The entire model object is not loaded, so the application will not be able to use the model object.

### Solution:

Ensure the entire model object is loaded from the file:

```
model = ...
state_dict = torch.load(state_dict_path, map_location="cpu")
model.load_state_dict(state_dict)
```
