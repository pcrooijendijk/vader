Patch:
state_dict_path = os.path.join(args.repo_path, subfolder, "diffusion_pytorch_model.bin")

# Safe: only load as state_dict (not entire model object)
state_dict = torch.load(state_dict_path, map_location="cpu")

if not isinstance(state_dict, dict):
    raise ValueError("Loaded file is not a valid state_dict dictionary.")

model.load_state_dict(state_dict)
