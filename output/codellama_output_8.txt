Metadata:
CWE: CWE-78
Severity: High
Language: javascript, html

### Explanation:

JavaScript code is not sanitized before being printed to HTML. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the
page, which will be executed when the victim loads the page.

### Mitigation:

Sanitize user input before printing to HTML.

### Reference:

### Other information:

This is a great example of how to exploit a vulnerability to inject malicious JavaScript code into an HTML page.

### Proof of Concept:

Patch:
if (req.query.name) {
  const name = sanitize(req.query.name);
  res.send(`Hello ${name}!`);
} else {
  res.send("Hello world!");
}

Safe:
if (req.query.name) {
  const name = sanitize(req.query.name);
  res.send(`Hello ${name}!`);
} else {
  res.send("Hello world!");
}

Metadata:
CWE: CWE-78
Severity: High
Language: python, html

### Explanation:

The attacker is able to include malicious JavaScript code in the HTML response because the vulnerable code is not sanitizing
the user input before printing it to the HTML page.
