Test Case 1
•	Objective: Successfully upload a simple valid file inside the allowed directory.
•	Input:
o	path = "testfile.txt"
o	contents = "Hello World!"
•	Expected Result:
o	File testfile.txt should be created inside /var/www/uploads/.
•	Outcome:
o	File is saved successfully.

Test Case 2
•	Objective: Attempt path traversal to overwrite sensitive system file.
•	Input:
o	path = "../../etc/passwd"
o	contents = "malicious content"
•	Expected Result:
o	Application detects invalid path and returns an error (e.g., "Invalid file path!").
•	Outcome:
o	File write is blocked; no file is created outside the allowed directory.



Test Case 3: 
•	Objective: Upload a file with a slightly complex filename (without traversal).
•	Input:
o	path = "nestedfolder/validfile.txt" (after applying basename() this becomes validfile.txt)
o	contents = "Sample Data"
•	Expected Result:
o	File validfile.txt should be safely saved inside /var/www/uploads/.
•	Outcome:
o	File upload succeeds without any issues.
Test Case 4
•	Objective: Attempt to bypass using symbolic link tricks to traverse directories.
•	Input:
o	path = "symlink/../../var/www/html/secret.php"
•	Expected Result:
o	Application should reject the request because realpath() verification fails.
•	Outcome:
o	File write is blocked; no file is created outside /var/www/uploads/.
Test Case 5
•	Objective: Try uploading a file with an empty filename.
•	Input:
o	path = ""
o	contents = "some content"
•	Expected Result:
o	Application detects the missing filename and rejects the upload with an error.
•	Outcome:
o	File is not created; application responds with an error.
