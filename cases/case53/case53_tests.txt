Test Case 1: Normal Input (Baseline)
Test Case 2: Book Name Overflow (Buffer Overflow)
Test Case 3: Author Name Overflow
Input:
Book No: B001
Book Name: Introduction to C++
Author: Bjarne
Expected Output:
Book record created successfully
No crash or memory issue
Purpose: Validate that normal use does not fail.
Input:
Book No: B001
Book Name: A repeated 100 times
Author: Test
Expected Output:
Application crashes or corrupts adjacent memory (e.g., shows garbage or segfaults)
May overwrite aname or even cause illegal instruction in some setups
Purpose: Trigger overflow in bname[50]
Input:
Book No: B002
Book Name: C++ Basics
Author: B repeated 60 times
Expected Output:
Overwrites memory beyond aname[20]
Application may crash or behave unexpectedly
Test Case 4: Book Number Overflow
Test Case 5: Chained Overflow
Test Case 6: Input Sanitization Fix
(Only after code is patched to use cin.getline() or std::string )
Input:
Book No: 1234567890
Book Name: Test
Author: Test
Expected Output:
bno[6] overflow; may overwrite bname or internal flags
Potential unexpected output or crash
Input:
Book No: OVERFLOW
Book Name: A x 100
Author: B x 100
Expected Output:
Overflows multiple fields
May cause crash or execute unintended instructions (especially with -fno-stackprotector )
Input:
Book No: B003
Book Name: A x 60
Author: B x 30
Expected Output:
Excess characters are truncated or ignored
No crash or overflow occurs
