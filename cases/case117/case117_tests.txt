# Test Case: SSH Argument Injection in Gogs (CWE-88)

# Setup:
# - Ensure you have a Gogs user account with an SSH key added.
# - Connect via SSH using a malicious env variable to inject payload.

ssh -o SendEnv="EVILVAR=; shutdown -h now" username@your-gogs-server

# Expected Result:
# - BEFORE the patch: Gogs may accept and process the environment variable.
# - AFTER the patch: Gogs should reject suspicious payloads and log an error.
