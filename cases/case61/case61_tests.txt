CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
	if(!oturum_kontrol(sGet('user'),sGet('pass'))){
		header('Location:../login.php'); // Redirects but does NOT stop the script!
	}
header('Location:../login.php'); only sends the redirect header.
It does NOT automatically stop the PHP script execution. 
 

Here I have changed the header and when use burpsuite to intercept the http://localhost/Web-Sayfasi/login.php it will redirect automatically redirecting  to files without the need of login.

How an attacker can exploit:
1.	Visit admin.php?sayfa=ekle (direct access to user adding page).
2.	Server tries to redirect to login page.
3.	BUT the PHP script still executes and includes the sensitive pages (userekle.php) in the background.
4.	So the attacker can view or interact with protected content without logging in.
The server sends the login redirect, but keeps rendering the protected page underneath

Fix:
	if(!oturum_kontrol(sGet('user'),sGet('pass'))){
		header('Location:../login.php'); 
		exit(); // Immediately stop script execution after redirect
	}
Add exit(); immediately after any header('Location:...') call to prevent unauthorized page content from loading.
