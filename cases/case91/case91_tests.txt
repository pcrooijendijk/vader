Test Case 1: Malicious Token Deserialization
1. Craft a malicious payload using pickle to execute arbitrary code.
2. Encode the payload and set it in the 'reflex-client-token' header.
3. Send a POST request to the upload endpoint with the malicious token.
4. Verify that the server does not deserialize the token using pickle and the payload is not executed.
